For example, Data Analysts receive objectives from higher ups to review company data to provide them with information about employee retention, customer service abilities or sales quotas. Further, Data Analysts usually only pull data from company databases to complete their tasks.\\nIn contrast, Data Scientists take on a more proactive role within a corporation. They pull data from company databases and outside sources to make predictions about company success or other factors. Based on their assessments, they address reoccurring issues or potential business opportunities to upper management. Therefore, they don’t rely on instructions from upper management about what to look for, like Data Analysts do. For this reason, Data Scientists hold more seniority and may communicate with Data Analysts to research certain data figures.\\nOn a typical day, a Data Scientist reviews their to-do list and searches internal or external databases for specific data points relating to areas like employee retention or market trends. Throughout the day, they participate in meetings with the data team and upper management officials to discuss their findings and make predictions about company operations based on their data. During downtime, they compile reports and create charts to illustrate their findings.\\nA good Data Scientist has excellent written and verbal communication, which enables them to write reports and present their findings to upper management regarding topics like. market predictions, financial goals or employee training needs. Further, a good Data Scientist values continued education and makes an effort to obtain certifications in different coding languages and data management software to perform their job duties well. A good Data Scientist also enjoys working as part of a team and communicates with their coworkers to pull data and compile reports.\\nJob Description Examples\\nNeed help writing a job description for a specific role?

For example, Data Analysts receive objectives from higher ups to review company data to provide them with information about employee retention, customer service abilities or sales quotas. Further, Data Analysts usually only pull data from company databases to complete their tasks.\\nIn contrast, Data Scientists take on a more proactive role within a corporation. They pull data from company databases and outside sources to make predictions about company success or other factors. Based on their assessments, they address reoccurring issues or potential business opportunities to upper management. Therefore, they don’t rely on instructions from upper management about what to look for, like Data Analysts do. For this reason, Data Scientists hold more seniority and may communicate with Data Analysts to research certain data figures.\\nOn a typical day, a Data Scientist reviews their to-do list and searches internal or external databases for specific data points relating to areas like employee retention or market trends. Throughout the day, they participate in meetings with the data team and upper management officials to discuss their findings and make predictions about company operations based on their data. During downtime, they compile reports and create charts to illustrate their findings.\\nA good Data Scientist has excellent written and verbal communication, which enables them to write reports and present their findings to upper management regarding topics like. market predictions, financial goals or employee training needs. Further, a good Data Scientist values continued education and makes an effort to obtain certifications in different coding languages and data management software to perform their job duties well. A good Data Scientist also enjoys working as part of a team and communicates with their coworkers to pull data and compile reports.\\nJob Description Examples\\nNeed help writing a job description for a specific role?
